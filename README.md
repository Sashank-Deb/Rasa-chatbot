### Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contextual assistants on:
- Facebook Messenger
- Slack
- Google Hangouts
- Webex Teams
- Microsoft Bot Framework
- Rocket.Chat
- Mattermost
- Telegram
- Twilio
- Your own custom conversational channels

Rasa helps you build contextual assistants capable of having layered conversations with
lots of back-and-forth. In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual
assistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously
discussed â€“ Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.

### Rasa installation guide

`Step 1`: So I'll write down how I figured this out. First, if you don't have the Anaconda package manager install it from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). (While installing click the checkbox to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable.)

`Step 2`: Now open up the anaconda prompt and go to the directory where you want to run `rasa`.

`Step 3`: Then we can create a new conda environment by running `conda create --name installingrasa python==3.8.5` to keep all of our dependencies together in a centralized place. Finally activate the environment by `conda activate installingrasa`

`Step 4`: Install UJSON and Tensorflow that will help us to work with rasa.
```bash
conda install ujson
conda install tensorflow
```
`Step 5`: Ultimately we can install `rasa`. Here we are going to install it via `pip` rather than `conda`. (There is no conda version for rasa at the moment I'm writing this)
```bash
pip install rasa
```
`Step 6`: In order to run Tensorflow on windows, we need to download visual c++ separately. Find the executable from the [official website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0). And now we can run `rasa init` without errors and initialize new bot.
